  * Issue #15: open-vcdiff fails to compile on Fedora 9
    * Add header <string.h> to source files that use memcmp, memset, memcpy,
      and/or strlen.
    * Change C++-style includes like <cstdlib> to C-style includes like
      <stdlib.h> so that function names are guaranteed to be defined
      in the global namespace.
  * Issue #8: Decoder should not crash if it runs out of memory
    * Add a new interface that places a limit on the maximum bytes allowed in
      a single target window or a target file.
  * Issue #13: Add unit test for vcdiff command-line executable
    * Unit test vcdiff_test.sh added for Linux and Mac builds.
    * Still need to add a Windows version of this test.

  * Fix problems found on OpenBSD platform.
    * Issue #1: vcdiff command-line executable crashes on startup.
      This was a problem with the stub intended to replace pthread_once if the
      package was not linked with the pthreads library.  Simplify gflags.cc to
      assume single-threaded execution.
    * Issue #2: Unit test blockhash_test fails.
      Define VCDIFF_USE_BLOCK_COMPARE_WORDS for BSD platforms to ensure that
      the most efficient version of memcmp is used in the encoder's inner loop.
  * Fix compilation warnings in gtest-filepath.cc: "warning: missing
    initializer for member 'stat::...'"
