open-vcdiff (0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix problems found on OpenBSD platform.
    * Issue #1: vcdiff command-line executable crashes on startup.
      This was a problem with the stub intended to replace pthread_once if the
      package was not linked with the pthreads library.  Simplify gflags.cc to
      assume single-threaded execution.
    * Issue #2: Unit test blockhash_test fails.
      Define VCDIFF_USE_BLOCK_COMPARE_WORDS for BSD platforms to ensure that
      the most efficient version of memcmp is used in the encoder's inner loop.
  * Fix compilation warnings in gtest-filepath.cc: "warning: missing
    initializer for member 'stat::...'"
